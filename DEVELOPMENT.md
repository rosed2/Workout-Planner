**Work Log**

1. 4-7-19 Came up with project proposal.
1. 4-7-19 Found an api that contains information about different exercises but still trying to make
it work as it runs on localhost. I plan on getting data from a JSON file and then implementing 
this functionality after I get it working if I have time.
1. 4-8-19 Started playing around with ofxGui. I can successfully create a panel, buttons, 
and sliders that interact with another class. 
1. 4-9-19 Started experimenting with ofxJSON. I can successfully read from a JSON file 
and print out the data it contains. 
1. 4-10-19 Successfully learned how to get an array from a JSON file.
1. 4-15-19 Finished creating JSON file of exercises.
