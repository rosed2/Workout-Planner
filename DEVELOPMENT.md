Log of Work

1. Came up with project proposal
1. Found an api that contains information about different exercises but still trying to make
it work as it runs on localhost. I plan on getting data from a JSON file and then implementing 
this functionality after I get it working.
1. Started playing around with ofxGui and ofxJSON. For ofxGui, I can successfully
create buttons and sliders that interact with another class. For ofxJSON, I can successfully
read from a JSON file and print out the data it contains.
