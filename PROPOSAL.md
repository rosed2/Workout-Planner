# Project Proposal

**Workout Planner**

This project will allow the user to create and track their own workout routines.
They will be able to create workout plans by searching for exercises based on
different criteria (such as muscle group). These workout plans can then be saved
into the user's library of plans. The user will also have a calendar for the week
so they can plan in advance what workout plan they want to do on each day.
This planner will also keep track of their previous completions of the exercises 
to keep track of the number of reps, weights they used, or time needed to complete 
the exercise as applicable.



**openFrameworks Libraries**

* ofxJSON : https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON
	* I'll use this library to get data about different exercises from either a JSON file or 
from an API call. 

* ofxDatGui : https://github.com/braitsch/ofxDatGui
	* I'll use this library to create the user interface.
