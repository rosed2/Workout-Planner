# Project Proposal

**Workout Planner**

This project will allow the user to create and plan their own workout routines.
They will be able to create workout plans by searching for exercises based on
different criteria (such as muscle group, equipment needed, name). These workout plans can then 
be saved into the user's library of plans. The user can then search for workout plans by 
name or what exercises it contains. The user will also have a calendar for the week
so they can plan in advance what workout plan they want to do on each day.




**openFrameworks Libraries**

* ofxJSON : https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON
	* I'll use this library to get data about different exercises from either a JSON file or 
from an API call. 

* ofxDatGui : https://github.com/braitsch/ofxDatGui
	* I'll use this library to create the user interface.
